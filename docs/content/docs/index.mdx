Formerly known as the Solana Program Library (SPL), the
[Solana Program](https://github.com/solana-program) organization continues to
deploy certain SPL programs to mainnet-beta.

In addition, the organization includes re-implementations of native programs
which target the Solana Virual Machine, also known as "core BPF programs".
